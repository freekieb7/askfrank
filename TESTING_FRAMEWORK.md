# Testing Framework Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive testing framework that has been implemented for the AskFrank Healthcare IT Platform.

## Overview

The testing framework provides a complete testing infrastructure with unit tests, integration tests, mocks, test utilities, and comprehensive coverage reporting. It follows Go testing best practices and includes automated database setup for integration testing.

## Test Structure

```
tests/
├── test_runner.go              # Comprehensive test execution script
├── mocks/
│   └── mocks.go               # Mock implementations for testing
├── service/
│   └── auth_test.go           # Unit tests for authentication service
├── integration/
│   └── auth_test.go           # Integration tests for authentication flows
├── validator/
│   └── validator_test.go      # Unit tests for input validation
└── testutil/
    └── testutil.go            # Test utilities and helpers
```

## Available Test Commands

### Basic Test Commands
- `make test` - Run all tests with the comprehensive test runner
- `make test-unit` - Run unit tests only (service and validator tests)
- `make test-integration` - Run integration tests with database setup
- `make test-watch` - Run tests in watch mode for development

### Coverage Commands
- `make test-coverage` - Run all tests and generate coverage report
- `make test-coverage-unit` - Generate unit test coverage report (coverage-unit.html)
- `make test-coverage-integration` - Generate integration test coverage report (coverage-integration.html)

### Database Commands
- `make test-db-setup` - Setup test database with Docker PostgreSQL
- `make test-db-cleanup` - Cleanup test database
- `make test-db-reset` - Reset test database (cleanup + setup)

### Additional Commands
- `make test-benchmark` - Run benchmark tests
- `make test-clean` - Clean test artifacts (coverage files)

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

#### Authentication Service Tests (`tests/service/auth_test.go`)
- **TestAuthService_Login** - Tests login functionality with various scenarios:
  - Successful login with valid credentials
  - User not found scenarios
  - Invalid password handling
  - Email verification requirements
- **TestAuthService_Register** - Tests user registration:
  - Successful registration flow
  - Duplicate user handling
  - Password strength validation
- **TestAuthService_PasswordStrengthValidation** - Comprehensive password strength testing

#### Validator Tests (`tests/validator/validator_test.go`)
- **TestValidator_PasswordStrength** - Password complexity validation
- **TestValidator_DisposableEmail** - Disposable email detection
- **TestValidator_RequiredFields** - Required field validation
- **TestValidator_LoginRequest** - Login request validation

### Integration Tests

#### Authentication Integration Tests (`tests/integration/auth_test.go`)
- **TestAuthIntegration** - End-to-end authentication flows:
  - Complete registration and login flow with database
  - Duplicate registration handling
  - Invalid credentials testing
  - Password strength validation through API
- **TestDatabaseTransactions** - Database operation testing:
  - User CRUD operations
  - User registration operations with referential integrity

## Test Infrastructure

### Mock System (`tests/mocks/mocks.go`)
Provides comprehensive mocks for external dependencies:
- **MockRepository** - Database operation mocking
- **MockSessionStore** - Session storage mocking  
- **MockEmailService** - Email service mocking

### Test Utilities (`tests/testutil/testutil.go`)
Comprehensive utilities for consistent testing:
- **SetupTestDB()** - Test database setup with migration
- **CleanupTestDB()** - Database cleanup between tests
- **CreateTestUser()** - Test user creation with unique data
- **ValidPassword()** / **InvalidPasswords()** - Password test data
- **makeJSONRequest()** - HTTP request testing helpers

### Test Runner (`tests/test_runner.go`)
Sophisticated test execution system:
- Color-coded output for different test types
- Comprehensive coverage reporting
- Organized test suite execution
- Clear summary reporting

## Database Testing

The framework includes automated PostgreSQL database testing:

1. **Automatic Setup**: Integration tests automatically start PostgreSQL via Docker Compose
2. **Migration Handling**: Test database is automatically migrated using repository.Migrate()
3. **Isolation**: Each test gets a clean database state
4. **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup between tests to prevent interference

## Repository Interface Pattern

The testing framework implements a repository interface pattern for improved testability:

```go
type RepositoryInterface interface {
    CreateUser(user model.User) error
    GetUserByEmail(email string) (*model.User, error)
    GetUserByID(id uuid.UUID) (*model.User, error)
    UpdateUser(user model.User) error
    DeleteUser(id uuid.UUID) error
    // ... additional methods
}
```

This allows for:
- Easy mocking in unit tests
- Clean separation between business logic and data access
- Improved testability of service layer

## Coverage Reporting

The framework generates detailed coverage reports:
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Focuses on business logic coverage
- **Integration Test Coverage**: Measures end-to-end test coverage
- **HTML Reports**: Visual coverage reports for easy analysis

## Test Data Management

### Password Testing
- **ValidPassword()**: Returns "SecurePass123!" for successful test cases
- **InvalidPasswords()**: Array of weak passwords for validation testing

### User Data
- **MockUser()**: Creates test users with random UUIDs and timestamps
- **CreateTestUser()**: Creates and persists test users in database

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't affect others
2. **Comprehensive Mocking**: External dependencies are properly mocked
3. **Clear Test Structure**: Tests are organized by functionality and type
4. **Database Testing**: Real database integration testing with proper setup/cleanup
5. **Coverage Measurement**: Comprehensive coverage reporting at multiple levels
6. **CI/CD Ready**: All tests can be run in automated environments

## Running Tests

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Run all tests during development
make test

# Run specific test types
make test-unit
make test-integration

# Generate coverage reports
make test-coverage-unit
make test-coverage-integration

# Watch mode for TDD
make test-watch
```

### CI/CD Integration
The testing framework is designed to work in CI/CD environments with proper database setup and comprehensive reporting.

## Future Enhancements

The testing framework is designed to be extensible:
- Additional test types can be added to the test runner
- New mock services can be added to the mocks package
- Test utilities can be expanded for additional functionality
- Coverage thresholds can be implemented for quality gates

This comprehensive testing framework ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability for the AskFrank Healthcare IT Platform.
